# Blog_Website

This blog website is designed in python using flask framework and mongodb as a database.

For connectivity to the DB and defining the ORM structure for the mongoDb database I used MongoEngine rather than PyMongo as a connector.

Tools used in building this project are :

# Front End : HTML , CSS , JS , BootStrap 5

# Back End : Python version - 3.11 , MongoDB version - 6.0.3

# Frameworks or softwares used : VS Code , Flask , MongoDB Compass 

The Required modules are all available in the requirements.txt file
